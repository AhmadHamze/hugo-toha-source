      <description>Recently I started a web development job as a front-end developer, here are a few things I learned so far.
1. Make sure to have the correct working environment As you might know, preparing the development environment is an essential step when you start a new project.

      <description>Advice to my past self regarding programming In this blog, I talk about a few things that I wish somebody told me back when I started learning to program by myself, I hope you can benefit from this if you&amp;rsquo;re also new to programming.
1. Talk to real programmers who know what they&amp;rsquo;re doing Getting into the world of programming is quite easy, all you have to do is own a laptop, watch YouTube videos and try to build programs yourself.</description>
