Randomness is an interesting concept, we have seen in previous blogs how it can be harnessed to compute mathematical constants, and even create a universal computer. In this blog we will see how randomness can be used to model diffusion.
Diffusion can be defined as the movement of particles from a region of higher concentration to a region of lower concentration.
This is a common phenomenon, and can be observed in our daily lives. For example, when we add sugar to a cup of tea, the sugar particles diffuse throughout the tea.
Similarly, when we spray perfume in a room, the perfume particles diffuse throughout the room. In this blog we will see how we can model diffusion using random walks.

## Mathematical model of diffusion

Let's start by defining our problem mathematically, we will use a method known as descritization to model our problem.
