Dear frontend developers, I owe you all an apology!

Let me start by introducing myself a bit. I studied mathematics at university, during that time I did some scientific programming.
Mostly solving differential equations, linear algebra, and optimization problems. Most of this was done using Python and Matlab.
After graduation, I delved more into "serious programming" and started learning C++ and Java, I liked working with C++ and did a few projects with it. However, my heart was still attached to the scientific side of programming, I did some data science and machine learning (obviously with Python).

## My first encounter with frontend development

During this period of constant learning it was a matter of time before I encountered frontend development. I remember hearing a lot about Angular, React, and Javascript, but I did not have the time to learn any of them.

Until one day, I had a job interview for a backend role, and the interviewer asked me if I knew any frontend technologies.
I said no, the interviewer said that they have an online test that was initially created for a full-stack role and that they couldn't find the time to remove the frontend parts.
She asked me if I could do the test and ignore the frontend parts. I said yes, and I did the test.

This was my first every encounter with html, css and Javascript. The Javascript part wasn't surprising, after all I had some experience with Python and C++.
But the html and css parts were out of this world, I had no idea what this is, it didn't even look like programming to me.

After a week, I got a call from the company, they said that I did well in the backend part, but the frontend part was a disaster and it wouldn't be possible to hire me for the backend role.

> Yeah, it turns out they were looking for a full-stack developer, not just backend, I guess the HR said one thing and the hiring managers wanted something else.

I didn't get upset much, however, my ego was hurt and I kept thinking what if I knew a bit of frontend development? That couldn't hurt me right?

So, I thought to myself, give it a go, just a few days of frontend and see where that takes you.

### Initial thoughts

I started with just html and css, **I didn't like it!**, I thought it was boring, I thought it was not real programming.

Who cares about how a website looks? If I need to use the website, I'm going to suck it up and use it, I don't care about the colors, the fonts, the animations, etc.
And Javascript? Well, you can find a list on the page and insert a new element in it, what's the big deal?

That was it, I was done with frontend, and went back to what I was doing before.

## Second encounter

After more than a year, I just had finished a role in AI and was looking for a new job. A group of friends told me that they are working on a project and they need a React developer. My lack of skills (non-existent at the moment) was not a problem for them, after all, the groups dedication will make or break the project.
