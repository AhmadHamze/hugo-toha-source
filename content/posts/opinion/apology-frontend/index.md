Dear frontend developers, I owe you all an apology!

Let me start by introducing myself a bit. I studied mathematics at university, during that time I did some scientific programming.
Mostly solving differential equations, linear algebra, statistics, and optimization problems. This was done using Python and Matlab.
After graduation, I delved more into "serious programming" and started learning C++ and Java, I liked working with C++ and did a few projects with it. However, my heart was still attached to the scientific side of programming, I did some data science and machine learning with Python.

## My first encounter with frontend development

During this period of constant learning it was a matter of time before I encountered frontend development. I remember hearing a lot about Angular, React, and Javascript, but I did not have the time to learn any of them.

Until one day, I had a job interview for a backend role, and the interviewer asked me if I knew any frontend technologies.
I said no, the interviewer said that they have an online test that was initially created for a full-stack role and that they couldn't find the time to remove the frontend parts.
She asked me if I could do the test and ignore the frontend parts. I said yes, and I did the test.

This was my first ever encounter with html, css and Javascript. The Javascript part wasn't surprising, after all I had some experience with Python and C++.
But the html and css parts were out of this world, I had no idea what this is, it didn't even look like programming to me.

After a week, I got a call from the company, they said that I did well in the backend part, but the frontend part was a disaster and it wouldn't be possible to hire me for the backend role.

> Yeah, it turns out they were looking for a full-stack developer, not just backend, I guess the HR said one thing and the hiring manager wanted something else.

I didn't get upset much, however, my ego was hurt and I kept thinking what if I knew a bit of frontend development? That couldn't hurt me right?

I thought to myself, give it a go, just a few days of frontend and see where that takes you.

### Initial thoughts

I started with just html and css, **I didn't like it!**, I thought it was boring, I thought it was not real programming.

Who cares about how a website looks anyway? If I need to use the website, I'm going to suck it up and use it, I don't care about the colors, the fonts, the animations, etc.
And Javascript? Well, you can find a list on the page and insert a new element in it, what's the big deal?

That was it, I was done with frontend, and went back to what I was doing before.

## Second encounter

After more than a year, I just had finished a role in AI and was looking for a new job. A group of friends told me that they are working on a project and they need a React developer.
My lack of skills (non-existent at the time) was not a problem for them, after all, the group's dedication will make or break the project.

So, here I am working with React! It was different than what I expected, because we were using Material UI, I didn't have to write a lot of css, and the jsx part was copied and pasted.

I spent most of the time handling the state, passing props, using hooks, and creating typescript interfaces.
I was enjoying what I was doing, it wasn't boring, and most importantly it wasn't easy!

After not that long, the project was finished, I had a new perception of what frontend developers do, however, I still thought that at least when it comes to html and css, it's not that valuable of a thing.

### Working with the experts

Fast forward a few months, I am working as a full-stack developer with React in the frontend. The difference this time was the team, I was working with frontend developers who were experts in their field.

Unlike my first experience with React, out of the box components were not enough, they either needed a lot of customization or we needed to build components from scratch.

Building context menus and tooltips was very hard! Tooltips just don't work like you want them all the time. You always find cases where your tooltip don't show up, or it shows up in the wrong place, or it's not styled correctly.

And context menus? Handling their position, their visibility, their content, and their animations was a nightmare!
I found myself struggling between building from scratch or customizing pre-existing components. The code was just getting harder and longer and the components were not behaving as they should.

I would ask for help from the seniors from time to time, sometimes they would fix the issue I'm stuck at within minutes!
They would always blow my mind with their knowledge of css.
Most importantly, however, is how they think about the component they're creating. They don't just create a component so that it works, they always have in mind how it will **evolve in the future**.

Will it be easy to add new features to it? Customize it? Maintain it?
What about the performance? How will it behave in different screen sizes? How do we handle the edge cases.

> Side note here, unlike when you are doing a leet code problem, edge cases in frontend development are not just about the input, it's much more complicated.

It took me a while to figure it out, but yes, it matters how the buttons on the screen are placed, the colors matters, the tooltips, the menus, the tables, the modals, the forms, the responsiveness, it all matters.

If you can't do html and css, you can't do any of the above and that's a big problem.

### Debugging

Senior frontend engineers almost always have the devtools opened when working.

In frontend, debugging is a completely different game, it's not just about inserting a breakpoint and checking the values of the variables.
The browser has an extensive set of tools that you need to know how to use. If you do that, you can debugg the css, the html, the javascript, the network, the performance, and much more.

With the devtools, you can find out why your page is so laggy, is there any components rendering when they should not? Are there any network requests that are taking too long?

This is another aspect of frontend development that makes it special. When you keep you eyes on the devtools, css just becomes much easier. Instead of making changes and refreshing the page, you can just do it live, and see the changes immediately.

When building something feels more comfortable, the task becomes more enjoyable. This made all the difference for me, I started to enjoy css more because of the devtools.

### The apology

Dear frontend developers, I am sorry that I underestimated your work. I am sorry that I thought that what you do is not real programming. I know better now, and I hope that you will accept me among you.
