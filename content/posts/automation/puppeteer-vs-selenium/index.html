      This blog is for learning purposes only, you can find the complete code on

    </p>
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      In a previous
      <a
        href="https://ahmadhamze.github.io/posts/automation/selenium-speed-test/"
        >blog</a
      >
      I created a selenium bot that performs the
      <a href="https://10fastfingers.com">10fastfingers</a> typing speed, it
      scored 960 WPM.<br />
      This code was far from perfect, I did it quickly without taking into
      consideration the best performance that could be achieved. This blog is
      aimed at enhancing the Selenium code and comparing it with another
      automation library called <a href="https://pptr.dev/">Puppeteer</a>.<br />
    </p>
    <p class="disclaimer">
      The comparison I'm about to show only scratches the surface of what both
      libraries can do, do not judge a certain library by what you're going to
      see, there are many different criteria that I am not taking into
      consideration.
    </p>
    <h2>The Enhanced Selenium Code</h2>
    <p>
      I will go over the enhancements made to the old code, if you need to check
      the old code here's the
      <a href="https://github.com/AhmadHamze/selenium-typingspeed">link</a>.
    </p>
    <h4>Waiting for the highlight class</h4>
    <p>
      The old approach I took to wait for all the words to appear on the page
      was to wait until the page completes loading, it turns out there is a much
      better approach.
    </p>
    <p>The current word you're supposed to type is always highlighted</p>
    <img src="./media/highlightedword.png" alt="highlightedword" />
    <p>This is done by applying a "highlight" class to the word</p>
    <img src="./media/highlightclass.png" alt="highlightedclass" />
    <p>
      We can wait for this class to appear instead of waiting for the whole page
      to load. We've already seen how to do similar things in the old code
    </p>
    <!-- prettier-ignore -->
    <pre>
        <code>
            WebDriverWait(driver, 10).until(
                EC.presence_of_element_located((By.CLASS_NAME, "highlight"))
            )
        </code>
    </pre>
    <h4>Regex Instead of Requests-html</h4>
    <p>
      In the old code, I used a scraping library called
      <a
        href="https://docs.python-requests.org/projects/requests-html/en/latest/"
        >requests-html</a
      >
      to parse the HTML retrieved from the page.<br />
      There are faster alternatives, simply search for the words inside the
      retrieved HTML using regex.
    </p>
    <!-- prettier-ignore -->
    <pre>
        <code>
            spans = re.findall(r"<span wordnr[^<]*", driver.page_source)
            words = map(lambda span : span.split(">")[1], spans)
            words = list(words)
        </code>
    </pre>
    <h4>Remove Selenium Space Key</h4>
    <p>
      In the old code, I used the built-in
      <span class="highlight">Keys.SPACE</span> after typing each word, which
      types the space bar. A faster alternative is to simply concatenate each
      word with a space.
    </p>
    <!-- prettier-ignore -->
    <pre>
        <code>
            for word in words:
                inputField.send_keys(word + " ")
        </code>
    </pre>
    <p class="disclaimer">
      I tried using a list comprehension instead of a for loop to make it faster
      but I couldn't notice a difference.
    </p>
    <p>
      That's all the improvements made to the Selenium code, now we can run the
      program and see the results, here is a video showing how fast the typing
      has become.
    </p>
    <div class="videoContainer">
      <video width="100%" controls>
        <source src="./media/selenium.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
        Your browser does not support HTML video.
      </video>
    </div>
    <p>
      Just like before, the code computes the typing speed, I also added the
      complete time taken to open, navigate, and close the browser, here's the
      result.
    </p>
    <img src="./media/seleniumruntime.png" alt="Selenium runtime" />
    <p>
      That's 2072 WPM! More than double the score of the old code (960 WPM), and
      the whole program took less than 18 seconds.<br />
      This is a lucky run, most of the runs score a bit more than 1700 WPM, and
      take around 22 seconds, this is related to the hardware and the internet
      speed that I am using.<br />
      The major contributor to this enhancement is concatenating a space to the
      end of each word, instead of using the provided space key from Selenium.
      This simple change made the biggest difference.
    </p>
    <h2>Puppeteer</h2>
    <p>
      Now it's the time to do the same thing with Puppeteer.<br />
      To avoid an unnecessary installation of another chrome browser, I used the
      <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/puppeteer-core">puppeteer-core</a>
      library which is identical to puppeteer, however, it doesn't come with a
      default Chrome browser.<br />
      You have to provide the location of your Chrome browser to puppeteer-core
      To be able to launch it.<br />
      Unlike Selenium, Puppeteer is built for chrome (it doesn't work on other
      browsers yet), so you don't need a driver to launch the browser.
    </p>
    <h4>Code</h4>
    <p>
      The default Configuration of Puppeteer does not open a browser, we can
      change that by setting the "headless" property to false.
    </p>
    <!-- prettier-ignore -->
    <pre>
        <code>
            const browser = await puppeteer.launch({
                executablePath: "/usr/bin/google-chrome",
                headless: false,
                // This line fixes the viewport of the browser
                defaultViewport: null,
              });
        </code>
    </pre>
    <p>
      The rest of the code is identical to Selenium, the only difference is when
      selecting the typing input.<br />
      10fastfingers opens with the cursor set on the typing input, so we don't
      need to select it if we can send the words directly. This can be done with
      Puppeteer
    </p>
    <pre>
      <code>
        for (word of words) {
          await page.keyboard.type(word + " ");
        }
      </code>
    </pre>
    <p>Now, let's run the code and see how fast it is</p>
    <div class="videoContainer">
      <video width="100%" controls>
        <source src="./media/puppeteer.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
        Your browser does not support HTML video.
      </video>
    </div>
    <p>
      You can clearly see that Puppeteer types slower than Selenium, here's the
      result
    </p>
    <img src="./media/puppeteerruntime2.png" alt="puppet runtime" />
    <p>
      624 WPM, and 50 seconds to complete, this is much slower than Selenium.<br />
    </p>
    <h2>Headless mode</h2>
    <p>
      The final comparison I tried is to run both programs on headless mode.<br />
      As mentioned before, the default behavior of Puppeteer is headless, so to
      enable it again just remove
      <span class="highlight">headless: false</span> from the code.<br />
      When it comes to Selenium you have to add these lines
    </p>
    <pre>
      <code>
        from selenium.webdriver.chrome.options import Options

        options = Options()
        options.headless = True
        # This line replaces the old driver
        driver = webdriver.Chrome(service=serv, options=options)
      </code>
    </pre>
    <p>
      Obviously, you're not going to see the words getting typed anymore. No
      other changes are made to the code so everything should be working
      properly.<br />
      However, if you're like me and want visual proof that this is still
      working fine, there is a way to do that. In 10fastfingers typing a correct
      word changes its color to green, otherwise, it's changed to red.
    </p>
    <img src="./media/words-color.png" alt="words color" />
    <p>
      Inspecting the words again, it turns out a class of "correct" is added to
      the word when it's typed correctly, otherwise the class "wrong" is added.
    </p>
    <img src="./media/inspect-correct.png" alt="" />
    <p>
      Therefore, to make sure everything is still fine we can simply print the
      HTML of the page after the program ends, we should see the "correct" class
      added to all words.<br />
      Indeed, that's what happens
    </p>
    <img src="./media/assert-correct.png" alt="assert correct" />
    <p>Here is the result of Selenium</p>
    <img src="./media/selenium-headless.png" alt="Selenium headless" />
    <p>And the result of Puppeteer</p>
    <img src="./media/puppeteernobrowser.png" alt="Puppeteer headless" />
    <p>
      The typing speed in headless mode is much more significant!<br />
      Selenium jumped to 5685 WPM and surprisingly Puppeteer has the advantage
      at 5715 WPM, still, the overall time taken by Puppeteer is more than that
      of Selenium (13 seconds for Selenium and 20 for Puppeteer).
    </p>
    <p>Here's a comparison table</p>
    <div class="center">
      <table>
        <th>Criteria</th>
        <th>Selenium</th>
        <th>Puppeteer</th>
        <tr>
          <td>Typing Speed (WPM)</td>
          <td>2072</td>
          <td>624</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Total Runtime (seconds)</td>
          <td>18</td>
          <td>50</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Typing Speed Headless Mode (WPM)</td>
          <td>5685</td>
          <td>5715</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Total Runtime Headless Mode (seconds)</td>
          <td>13</td>
          <td>20</td>
        </tr>
      </table>
    </div>
    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>
      It seems that Selenium wins this round, but Puppeteer has much more to
      offer, it's able to modify responses using the Chrome DevTools Protocol
      (CDP), I am yet to discover this technology.
