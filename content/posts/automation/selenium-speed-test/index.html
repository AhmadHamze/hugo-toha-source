      This blog is for learning purposes only, you can find the complete code on
      my
      <a href="https://github.com/AhmadHamze/selenium-typingspeed">Github</a>
      go there to find the instructions necessary to run the code.

    <h2>Background</h2>
    <p>
      The first time I ever used Selenium, I had to type a string into a search
      bar. Doing so, I couldn't see if a string was typed at all, to the point
      where I thought maybe it doesn't actually type words. I thought something
      else was going on.<br />
      I am also kind of addicted to typing speed websites, I spend much more
      time than I should on different sites where you're supposed to type some
      words and see how many words you can type within a certain amount of time
      (10fastfingers is such a website
      <a href="https://10fastfingers.com">https://10fastfingers.com</a>). The
      unit used to measure typing speed is words per minute, abbreviated as
      WPM.<br />
      Looking at the high scores, it seems that the top typing speed is a bit
      above 200 WPM. For someone like me who can score a 60 WPM on a good day,
      this is extraordinary, but it seems that actual human beings are capable
      of reaching such speed.<br />
      This is when I had the idea to do this small project, I want to see how
      fast can Selenium score on 10fastfingers.
    </p>
    <h2>Code</h2>
    <div>
      <p>
        In this section, I will briefly go over the code to explain how the
        project works.<br />
        Let's start by launching Selenium, the latest version requires the use
        of a "Service".
      </p>
      <!-- prettier-ignore -->
      <pre>
          <code>
              serv = Service(PATH)
              driver = webdriver.Chrome(service=serv)
              driver.get("https://10fastfingers.com/typing-test/english")
          </code>
      </pre>

      <p>This will launch a browser to the simple English test</p>
      <img src="./media/beginning.png" alt="10fastfingers begin test" />
      <p>
        The first thing we want to do is to inspect the box containing the
        words, we need to grab all the words to be able to make Selenium enter
        each one of them in the input box.
      </p>
      <img src="./media/box-inspect.png" alt="Inspecting box of words" />
      <p>
        As you can see, this is a "div" having an id of "row1", we can grab this
        div with Selenium like so
      </p>
      <!-- prettier-ignore -->
      <pre>
          <code>
              wordsContainer = WebDriverWait(driver, 10).until(
              EC.presence_of_element_located((By.ID, "row1"))
              )
          </code>
      </pre>
      <p>
        The code above waits up to ten seconds until an HTML element having an
        id of "row1" appears on the screen, this element is saved in the
        variable <span class="highlight">wordsContainer</span>.<br />
        Once this is done, we want to collect the words inside this container,
        which as we saw in the last image are located within "span" tags.
      </p>
      <!-- prettier-ignore -->
      <pre>
          <code>
              # Telling Selenium to wait for 10 seconds just to make sure the page will load completely
              driver.implicitly_wait(10)
              wordsContainer.find_elements(By.TAG_NAME, "span")
          </code>
      </pre>
      <p>
        After giving some time for the page to load, we will find all the
        elements within <span class="highlight">wordsContainer</span> that have
        a "span" tag, this is where the words are.
      </p>
    </div>
    <h3>Parsing using requests-html</h3>
    <div>
      <p>
        If you try to grab all the words using
        <span class="highlight"
          >wordsContainer.find_elements(By.TAG_NAME, "span")</span
        >, you will only find around 20 words, the rest will be empty
        strings!<br />
        I am not sure what is the reason for this, however, it doesn't matter,
        we can use <span class="highlight">driver.page_source</span> to view the
        complete HTML of the page which will contain the "row1" div and all the
        words inside of it.
      </p>
      <p>
        Here comes the part where I use a scraping library called
        <a
          href="https://docs.python-requests.org/projects/requests-html/en/latest/"
          >requests-html</a
        >
        to parse the HTML from
        <span class="highlight">driver.page_source</span>.
      </p>
      <!-- prettier-ignore -->
      <pre>
          <code>
              html = HTML(html=driver.page_source)
              match = html.find("#row1",first=True)
              words = match.text.split(" ")
          </code>
      </pre>
      The code above parses the HTML from the Selenium driver, then it locates
      the "row1" div, and finally, it extracts the text inside of it which will
      be a big string formed by each word within a span tag separated by a
      space.<br />
      (e.g. the string will be
      <span class="highlight">"next being another how could it's once ..."</span
      >)<br />
      The <span class="highlight">split</span> method will be applied to this
      string to get a list of words.
      <!-- prettier-ignore -->
      <pre>
          <code>
              ['next', 'being', 'another', 'how', "could", "it's", "once", ...]
          </code>
      </pre>
    </div>
    <h2>Typing With Selenium</h2>
    <div>
      <p>
        Now, we need to type the words into the input field. Just like we did
        previously, we need to select the input field where the words should be
        typed, inspecting the input we have <br />
        <img src="./media/inspect-input.png" alt="Inspect input" />
      </p>
      <p>
        this element has an id of "inputfield", so we need to locate it then
        type each word in the list <span class="highlight">words</span> followed
        by the space key.
      </p>
      <!-- prettier-ignore -->
      <pre>
          <code>
              inputField = WebDriverWait(driver, 10).until(
                  EC.presence_of_element_located((By.ID, "inputfield"))
                  )
                  for word in words:
                  inputField.send_keys(word)
                  inputField.send_keys(Keys.SPACE)
          </code>
      </pre>
      Here's a video of how fast Selenium is typing <br />
      <div id="videoContainer">
        <video width="100%" controls>
          <source src="./media/fastfingers-automation.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
          Your browser does not support HTML video.
        </video>
      </div>
      <p>
        As you can see Selenium completed all the words way before the countdown
        finishes!<br />
        If you wait till the time ends (that's why I am using
        <span class="highlight">time.sleep(60)</span> at the end of the code),
        10fastfingers will give you the following result <br />
        <img src="./media/10fastfingers-score.png" alt="score" /><br />
        Pretty impressive! But this is not an accurate score at all, to find out
        the actual score, we must get the exact duration when Selenium was
        typing.<br />
        We can do so by getting the time displayed in the countdown and
        subtracting it from 60.<br />

        <img src="./media/timer.png" alt="timer" /> <br />
      </p>
      <p>
        The id of the timer is "timer", we will select it just like before, then
        we will extract the text from it, format it to get the final two
        characters which will hold the number we're looking for. Don't forget to
        cast it to an integer before doing any mathematical operations.
      </p>
      <!-- prettier-ignore -->
      <pre>
          <code>
              timer = driver.find_element(By.ID, "timer")
              timer = timer.text[2:]
              timer = int(timer)
              print(f"{(len(words) * 60) / (60 - timer)} WPM")
          </code>
      </pre>
      <p>
        Running the code again, we can find out the real speed of Selenium (at
        least on my PC)<br />
        <img src="./media/real-speed.png" alt="real speed" />
      </p>
      <div id="conclusionContainer">
        <p id="conclusion">That's 960 WPM!</p>
      </div>
