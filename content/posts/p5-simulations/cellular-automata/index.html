    In the 1940's, John Von Neumann and Stanislaw Ulam wanted to design a computer able to self-repair itself.

    In the real world an object can be produced only from a more complex object, suppose you want to replicated a piece
    of paper.
    In order to create one you need to have a more complex object, a printer.
    The printer is a much more complex system than the paper, and in order to create a printer, you need a lot of
    smaller components which are themselves complex and so on.

    However, this is not what we happens in nature, cells are capable of self-replicating and self-repairing.
    So, scientists contemplated the idea of creating a system that has such capabilities.

  <h2>
    Simplifiying the problem
  </h2>
  <p>
    Tackling such a problem is not easy, so scientists decided to simplify the problem.

      How to find the logical mechanisms for self-reproduction?
    </span>

    Finding an algorithm to acheive transcription and translation would be a great start, it would also be easier to
    formalize these concept in a descrete world.
    <br />
    This is when the idea of cellular automata was born.
    <br />
    A cellular automata is a mathematical abstraction of the real world, a modeling framework in which everything is
    discrete.
    There are many examples of cellular automata, in this blog we will be looking at two examples, both use a square
    lattice (a grid).
    <br />
    Although the square lattice is the most common, it is possible to use a hexagonal lattice, a triangular lattice or
    even a
    three dimensional lattice (a cube).
    <br />
    It is also possible to make a simpler automaton, for example, a one dimensional automaton.
    Take a look at <a rel="https://www.wolframalpha.com/input?i=rule+30" target="_blank">wolfram's automata</a>.
  </p>
  <h2>The parity rule</h2>
  <p>
    In the first example we will be looking at an automaton (i.e. a specific cellular automata) that uses the parity
    rule.
    <br />
    Here a cell has only two states, dead or alive (0 or 1), a dead cell is a white cell, an alive cell is a black cell.
    Each cell sums up the states of its four neighbors (up, down, left, right).
    <br />
    If the sum is even, the new state of the cell is 0, otherwise it is 1.
  </p>
  <p class="describing an image">
    Each cell sums up the states of its four neighbors, you can see the neighboring cells in the image.
    These are the four white cells that have a black border.

  <p>
    If we start with only one cell alive, the next generation will look like so

  <h2>Boundary Conditions</h2>
  <p>
    Implementing the rule is pretty simple for the inner cells, but what about the cells on the edge?
    <br />
    How do we handle the cells that don't have four neighbors?
    <br />
    There are many ways to handle such cells (boundary conditions).
    <br />
  <ul>
    <li>A fixed boundary condition, where the state of the cell is fixed (you choose a fixed cell as a neighbor)</li>
    <li>Adiabatic, the same cell would be considered as a neighbor</li>
    <li>Periodic, the cells on the edge are considered as neighbors of the cells on the other side of the grid</li>
  </ul>
  <br />
  E.g. the neighboring cells for the top left cell would be:
  <ol>
    <li>The next cell on the right</li>
    <li>The next cell on the bottom</li>
    <li>The cell on the bottom left (this is the north neighbour)</li>
    <li>The cell on the top right (this is the west neighbour)</li>
  </ol>
  <br />
  In this blog we will be using the periodic boundary condition.

  <h3>P5.js implementation</h3>
  <p>
    It is relatively easy to create a cellular automata in p5.js.
